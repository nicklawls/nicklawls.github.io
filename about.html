## About

Greetings, Earthlings! I am not native to this world, but I'm learning how to get along here. The blog on this site serves as a record of my assimilation into human culture.

At any given time you might find me honing my programming and math skills, teaching high schoolers how to hit a bass drum correctly, exploring out-of-the-way places, listening to rock music, or spending time with some of my awesome friends from around the US. I also enjoy the challenge of trying to be as consistently rational as possible.

In the short term, I'm focused on finishing up a B.S. in Computer Science and getting a sweet job in software development. In the long term, I'm maniaclly interested in the application of mathematics, science, and engineering to large-scale governance problems. I want to get to the point where I can work on these kinds of problems full time.
